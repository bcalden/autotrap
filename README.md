autotrap
========
autotrap is a collection of automation utilities for use with the LOFAR Transient Pipeline (TraP - https://github.com/transientskp/tkp) and AWImager.
There are three main files used for image generation, sending the images to the TraP, and generating graphs as output. These files are image_automator.py, generate_trap.py, and graph_tools.py respectively.
The other file included, templates.py is called by generate_trap.py and contains templates for TraP parameters.
Descriptions of each with examples can be found below. For further usage information, please see the wiki.
